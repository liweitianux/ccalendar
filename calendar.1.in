.Op Fl H Ar calendar_home

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility processes calendar files and displays lines that fall into the
specified date range.
On the day before a weekend (normally Friday), events for the next
three days are displayed.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl A Ar num
Print lines from today and the next
.Ar num
days (forward, future).
.It Fl a
Process the calendar files
.Pa ( ~/.calendar/calendar )
of all users and mail the results to them.
This requires super-user privileges.
.It Fl B Ar num
Print lines from today and the previous
.Ar num
days (backward, past).
.It Fl d
Print debug messages.
This flag may be repeated multiple times to increase the verbosity.
.It Fl F Ar friday
Specify which day of the week is
.Dq Friday
(the day before the weekend begins).
The default is 5.
.It Fl f Pa calendar_file
Use
.Ar calendar_file
as the default calendar file.
If specified as
.Pa - ,
then read from standard input.
Note that this flag cannot be used together with the
.Fl a
flag.
.It Fl H Pa calendar_home
Use
.Ar calendar_home
as the calendar home directory.
Note that this flag cannot be used together with the
.Fl a
flag.
.It Fl h
Show the utility usage.
.It Fl L Ar latitude,longitude[,elevation]
Specify the location for use in some calculations, such as the current
Sun and Moon positions and their rise and set times.
The
.Ar latitude
and
.Ar longitude
arguments are given in units of degrees,
which can be a decimal number or in the DMS format of
.Dq [+-]d:m:s .
The
.Ar elevation
argument is optional and is given in units of meters.
If not specified, the
.Ar latitude
and
.Ar elevation
arguments are default to 0, while the
.Ar longitude
argument is calculated from the adopted UTC offset
(i.e., 15 degrees times the UTC offset in hours).
.It Fl s Ar category
Show information of the specified
.Ar category ,
which can take the following values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width chinese -compact
.It Cm chinese
Show the Chinese calendar and the 24 solar terms (a.k.a. Jieqi) in this year.
.It Cm julian
Show the Julian calendar.
.It Cm moon
Show Moon position, phases, rise and set times, and lunar events in this year.
.It Cm sun
Show Sun position, rise and set times, and solar events in this year.
.El
.It Fl T Ar hh:mm[:ss]
Specify the time of day to use instead of the current system time.
This time is only used in determining the Sun and Moon information.
.It Fl t Ar [[[CC]YY]MM]DD
Act like the specified value is
.Dq today
instead of using the current date.
If
.Ar YY
is specified, but
.Ar CC
is not,
a value for
.Ar YY
between 69 and 99 results in a
.Ar CC
value of 19.
Otherwise, a
.Ar CC
value of 20 is used.
.It Fl U Ar \(+-hh[[:]mm]
Specify the timezone with a UTC offset.
If not specified, the timezone of localtime is used.
.It Fl W Ar num
Print lines from today and the next
.Ar num
days (forward, future).
Similar to the
.Fl A
option but ignore weekends when calculating the number of days.
.El
.Sh FILE FORMAT
The calendar files are preprocessed by a limited subset of
.Xr cpp 1
internally, allowing the inclusion of shared calendar files.
This limited directive subset consists of
.Sy #include ,
.Sy #ifndef ,
.Sy #endif ,
and
.Sy #define .
If the calendar file to be included (via the
.Sy #include
directive) is not referenced by a full pathname,
.Nm
searches in its home directory
.Pa ( ~/.calendar
or specified by the
.Fl H
flag)
first, then in the
.Pa @@CALENDAR_ETCDIR@@
directory, and finally in the
.Pa @@CALENDAR_DIR@@
directory.
Both the C-style comment
.Pq Li /* ... */
and C++-style comment
.Pq Li // ...
are supported.
.Pp
The default calendar used by the
.Nm
utility is the
.Dq Gregorian calendar .
In addition, the following calendars are supported:
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width chinese -compact
.It Julian
The Julian calendar
.It Chinese
The Chinese calendar
.El
Specify
.Dq CALENDAR=<calendar>
in the calendar file to select the calendar to use.
The calendar will be reset to the default Gregorian calendar
at the end of the calendar file.
When a non-default calendar is selected, the matched events will
be printed with a secondary date formatted in the selected calendar.
.Pp
To handle calendars in national code table, specify
.Dq LANG=<locale>
in the calendar file, before the national names being used.
This setting will also make the event date in this calendar file
be formatted in national names in the output.
The locale change will be reset at the end of the calendar file.
.Pp
To handle the local name of sequences, specify them as
.Dq SEQUENCE=<first> <second> <third> <fourth> <fifth> <last>
in the calendar file.
.Pp
The names of the following special days are recognized:
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width 1234567890123456 -compact
.It Easter
Catholic Easter.
.It Paskha
Orthodox Easter.
.It Advent
First Sunday of Advent.
.It NewMoon
The lunar New Moon.
.It FullMoon
The lunar Full Moon.
.It MarEquinox
The solar equinox in March.
.It JunSolstice
The solar solstice in June.
.It SepEquinox
The solar equinox in September.
.It DecSolstice
The solar solstice in December.
.It ChineseNewYear
The first day of the Chinese year.
.It ChineseQingming
The Chinese Qingming festival (a.k.a. Tomb-Sweeping Day).
.It ChineseJieqi
The 24 solar terms (Jieqi) in Chinese calendar.
.El
These names may be reassigned to their local names via an assignment
like
.Dq <name>=<local_name>
in the calendar file, and then the
.Dq <local_name>
can also be used to specify the date.
.Pp
Other lines should begin with a year (optional), month and day.
They may be entered in multiple formats, either numeric or as
character strings.
If the proper locale is set (via
.Dq LANG=<locale> ) ,
national month and weekday names can be used as well.
Additional rules are as follows:
.Bl -bullet -offset indent
.It
Two numbers default to the month followed by the day.
.It
A single asterisk
.Pq Sq *
matches every month.
.It
A day without a month matches that day of every week.
.It
A day of zero means the last day of previous month.
.It
The names of special days may be followed by a
positive or negative integer to represent the date offset, like:
.Dq Easter+3
or
.Dq Paskha-4 .
.It
A weekday may be followed by a sequence name
.Dq ( First
.Li ...
.Dq Fifth ,
and
.Dq Last )
to specify moving events, like
.Dq the last Monday in April .
Numeric sequence
.Dq ( \(+-[12345] )
can also be used.
.It
A date may be followed by an asterisk
.Pq Sq *
to indicate that it is not fixed (i.e., changes from year to year).
.It
A date must be immediately followed by <tab> character(s), and then
followed by the event description.
Lines without containing a <tab> character are invalid and thus ignored.
.It
Lines starting with a <tab> character are treated as a continuation of
the previous line, allowing multiple-line description of an event.
.El
.Pp
The supported date styles can vary with calendars.
In the Gregorian calendar, the following date styles are supported:
.Bd -literal -offset indent

.Sh HISTORY
A
.Nm
command appeared in
.At v7 .
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility was significantly enhanced in
.Fx 9.0
by
.An Edwin Groothuis Aq Mt edwin@FreeBSD.org ,
and was later rewritten to support multiple calendars in
.Dx 5.9
by
.An Aaron LI Aq Mt aly@aaronly.me .
.Sh NOTES
The new and full moons are happening on the day indicated.
They can happen in the time period from the early morning to
the late evening.
.Pp
The adopted methods to calculate solar and lunar events are
simplified astronomical algorithms, so the accuracy of events is
within several minutes, provided that the precise location is specified.
Druids and Werewolves should double-check the start and end time of
solar and lunar events.
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
internal preprocessor only recognizes
.Sy #include ,
.Sy #ifndef ,
.Sy #endif ,
and
.Sy #define .
Quoted or escaped comment marks are not supported yet.
.Pp
An event can repeat at most 100 times in the specified date range.
The most repeated event is an weekly event, so a maximum of 100 repeats
covers a date range of about 2 years.
If more repeats of events are needed, you're likely using
.Nm
in the wrong way ;)
